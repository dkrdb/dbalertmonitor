This Python code searches for errors in a list of alert log files and sends an email to a specified recipient when an error is found.

The program reads a list of alert log file locations and a list of errors to look for in those files from two separate files. It then opens each alert log file and searches for the specified errors in the last 100 lines of the file. If an error is found, the program composes an email message containing information about the error, including the file name, the line number where the error occurred, and the lines before and after the error.

Finally, the program sends the email to the specified recipient using the mailx command. If an error occurs while sending the email, the program prints an error message.
